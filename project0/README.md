Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

My Project is a sample website for a company selling handmade leather shoes.

index.html is the Homepage. It includes several images, two bootstrap cards, using the bootstrap grid system, 
and a bootstrap navigation bar based on a link list.

The navigation bar is present on all 4 pages, so that any page can always be accessed from any of the others.
In addition to that, the Homepage includes direct links to the "Products" and "People" page in the respective card.

people.html is another page in the website, using 3 columns of the bootstrap grid system, each displaying a card with information about one of the (pretend) shoemakers.

shop.html includes a table and a bootstrap link button.

products.html is another web page, displaying (mock-up) product information in 2 bootstrap cards, arranged in different columns and rows together with 2 images.
This page includes two unordered lists.

layout.scss is the stylesheet for the website, using several variables for colors and font types, 
nesting and inheritance. layout.scss also includes an @media query. The CSS properties used include padding, font-family, font-size, color and margin.

The jpeg-files are the images used for the website.
